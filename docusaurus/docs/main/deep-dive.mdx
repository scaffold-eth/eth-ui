## Design principles

- Allow flexibility in how often a hook receives updates from the network. You can choose your update method, for example, polling or every block number.
- Easily use context
  - **ethersAppContext**
  - **contractAppContext** (new in V4): Access your contract easily anywhere in your app.
- Compatibility with different ways to pass in ethers provider
- Reducing RPC calls with easy caching. Uses React Query under the hood to cache any RPC calls. This lets you use Eth-hooks anywhere in the app and you don't have to worry about optimization. You will automatically get data from the cached layer without extra network calls.
- Typed contracts that make it easier to understand the contract interface, reducing mistakes.

### Providers

- EthersAppContext: The context in Eth-hooks uses ethers under-the-hood. Wrap your main app in context and that allows you to use context anywhere in your app (the provider, signer, account).
  - App wide providers with context
  - Override
    - Alternate context for web3-react
    - Pass in provider if you need

### Cache

Built with React-Query and EthersContext. Get a cache when you wrap your app in context.

- All hook results are cached by EthersContext
  - Prevents repeated calls to the network because the hooks hit the cache first.
  - No need to pass variables. If you use a hook anywhere in the app it will automatically hit the cache.
  - When the network or signer changes the cache is automatically invalidated so you don't get the wrong values.

### Data updates

There are several different options for updating hook data. Simply pass in your preferred method.

- **Default** is the hook updates every block
- You can set it to update every n/blocks
- Polling can be used (minimum time is 10 seconds to prevent spamming the network)
- Refresh on window focus or on mount
- Set stale time for data. Default is 30 seconds

### Hook return

The signature of the hook is returned.

- This is similar to useState. You get a tuple of [result, update]
  - Gives you the result or...
  - You can manually update the hook

### Contract context

You can call any contract with a simple hook.

- Automatically get external contracts that are verified
  - Automatically typed by context
- Hardhat contracts
  - Automatically typed by context
- Load unverified contracts from an ABI
  - BaseContract
